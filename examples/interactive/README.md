# HeadTailAssigner (HTA) Interactive version

Welcome to the HTA interactive version, where you can test the HTA package with an interface in Jupyter notebook. Unfortunately, HTA can not be used in fully extent in the interactive version, so we recommend using this example as a first tutorial and move to the non interactive example to understand how to use HTA in the terminal. In this manner, all the functionalities of HTA can be used.

## Documentation

Information about how to run this Jupyter Notebook can be found at [main.ipynb](main.ipynb)
